        <h2><em>Aaah, the magic of indian curry!</em></h2>
        <p>I love Indian food. So spicy and rich. There are many dishes that you can prepare at home, but I really love how simple you can make good curry with Patak's Extra Hot Curry Paste.</p>
        <p>This curry paste is really rich in flavor compared to others. Finding the right amount of spiciness for your palate might take some experimenting. My suggestion is to start with a smaller amount and remember to take notes for the next time.</p>
        <p>In this recipe I'll present an example of a curry dish using this curry paste. I've put extra vegetables as optional, that way if you have the other ingredients in your house you'll always be able to make this.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>400 gr chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>vegetables by choice</li>
            <li>200 gr coconut milk</li>
            <li>400 gr canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>spices</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Patak's Extra Hot Curry Paste</li>
            <li>rice</li>
           
            
            </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry the onion on low heat for a couple of minutes in a frying pan, than add chicken and raise the temperature to medium</li>
            <li>Add the selected vegetables and keep frying for 5 minutes. At this point I like to add spices like a little salt, dry garlic and pepper. Don't overdo it though, as we'll be adding curry too.</li>
            <li>Add the curry paste and keep stirring so that everything mixes well.</li>
            <li>Add cocunt milk and canned tomatoes and heat up until boiling temperature. Lower the heat and put a lid on the frying pan. If you don't have a tall enough pan, use a kettle for heating up tomatoes and coconut oil and add the previous fried ingredients to the kettle.</li>
            <li>Let simmer on low heat while you prepare the rice. Extended time in the kettle will just make the flavors richer.</li>
            
        </ol>
